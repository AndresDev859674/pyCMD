## Command Emulation & Compatibility 🤝

**pyCMD** offers **excellent emulation capabilities for both PowerShell and Windows Command Prompt (CMD)**, allowing you to run many familiar commands and scripts directly within its advanced environment.

However, it's important to note that while extensive, **this emulation is not yet 100% perfect for all scenarios.** You might encounter subtle differences or limitations when running extremely complex or highly specific native shell commands, or those that rely on deeply integrated system interactions. We are continuously working to improve and expand compatibility to cover an even broader range of commands in future updates. Your feedback helps us identify and resolve these nuances! 🚧
